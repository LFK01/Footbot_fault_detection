Master Thesis Code Repository
=============================

The thesis project was focused on the identification of the most performing features in the task of fault detection for swarms of robots. The agents have been simulated using ARGoS and RAWSim-O simulators, the data has been processed in Python using pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. We used a Gradient Boosting model and the Feature Permutation Importance tool to analyze data influence.
